# **Binary Femboys Minimalist Bytepatch DLL**

This repository provides a very minimalist bytepatch DLL with an integrated vmp patcher using signature scanning. This allows us to patch a running program without using x64dbg's .1337 or runtime patches.

# **Important**

This tool is not self explanatory at all, it requires a minimal understanding of Reverse Engineering, code and assembly, do not ask for support with it.

## **Usage**

1. **Download the DLL:**
   - Clone or download the repository to obtain the DLL file.
  
2. **Edit the DLL:**
   - Edit the signatures and patches to work with your program.
  
3. **Use it:**
   - Inject it into the desired program.

## **License**

Feel free to use and modify this tool as you like as long as you dont sell it or a different copy based on this source code.
